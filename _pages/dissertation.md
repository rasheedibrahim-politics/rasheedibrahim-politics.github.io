Why are voters in the habit of contacting their Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituency services and development even though those responsibilities mostly under purview of mayors and district and municipal executives? I argue that this is not a function of ignorance. Instead, I show how, when, and why citizens act strategically when they engage in political contact. Theoretically, my project reframes accountability in Africa not as a function of institutional design alone but as an interactive process shaped by citizens’ strategic assessments of elite vulnerability. First, citizens target MPs because MPs are electorally accountable elites who can use their proximity to power to lobby projects and services for their constituents. Second, I draw on Afrobarometer surveys, constituency-level elections, elite interviews with MPs, and original focus groups interviews to  show that voters in high-turnover constituencies are more likely to contact MPs. Finally, I show that voters are strategic by choosing when to contact – contacting more during the elections – and whom to contact – by contacting more if an MP holds an executive position and thus perceived as having more direct access to resources. My overarching theoretical contribution is that voters are strategic actors who perceive the most electorally accountable and able to deliver MPs and direct to whom they direct their demands even if they are not formally responsible for said services.
