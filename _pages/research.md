### Under Review 


## The Chief’s Resource Curse: Land Quality and Corruption among Traditional Leaders (with Vladimir Chlouba)

Scholars disagree about whether traditional leaders are inherently undemocratic and corrupt or constrained by informal accountability mechanisms. We advance this debate by developing the concept of a “chief's resource curse,” which posits that control over valuable resources drives traditional leaders' corrupt behavior, but only in contexts where informal checks on their power are weak. Using continent-wide survey data from Africa combined with a geocoded measure of land value, we show that higher soil quality is associated with greater perceived corruption among chiefs, but only where local institutions are less accountable. This interaction is robust across multiple model specifications and persists after adjusting for a range of individual-, group-level controls. These findings suggest that traditional leaders’ behavior is shaped not only by the material endowments they oversee but also by the informal institutional context in which they govern, highlighting the importance of accountability in curbing elite abuse in non-electoral settings.
